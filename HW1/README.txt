Additional Notes:
Class Teach, Project Teach, Project Enroll, Class Enroll are composite Entities similar to lecture example
Student can have one to many assigned tables 
A table can have one to many assigned students for different classes assuming all tables are in use 
Student can borrow zero or many books 
A book can be given to zero or one student  assuming Instructors canâ€™t borrow a book
Student can rate one or many instructors -> similar for project and class rate 
A unique instructor rate can belong to only one student -> similar for project and class rate 
A table can have zero or many projects -> Similar for room and project
A Project cab belong to one table -> similar for room and project
A project can have one or many assigned parts and vice versa 
Class and course relation is similar to lecture with the same assumptions 
Room and Building relation is similar to lecture with the same assumptions 
A unique table assignment can belong to only one table assuming all have assignments 
One table can be used for one to many assignments 
Considering an instructor can be on a leave, he/she can teach zero to many classes and oversee classes

1) For the sake of easiness, I created folders for task numbers and placed relevant files there.
2) Inside Q1&2 Folder, I have two screenshots. Since my home and chosen campus are far away points were small and needed to zoom in in pic 2.
3) For number 3 and 4, I have used Postgres+PostGIS
4) For Q4&5 and Q6, I provided additional screenshots with diff zoom levels since campus maps and home are far away.


Please let me know if you have any Question.
